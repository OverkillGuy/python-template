# Changelog for the python-template

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
The project uses semantic versioning (see [semver](https://semver.org)), though
templating versions are not perfect matches for semantic versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Project now explicitly licensed under GPLv3 or later, as was always meant, but
  not clearly delineated until now.
  - The repository generated by use of this project is of course your own, with
    no claim from me. The GPLv3 or later license applies to the template itself,
    before expanding the boilerplate.

## v1.8.1 - 2025-02-22

### Changed

- Dynamic versioning feature defaults to Off, to reflect its experimental status

### Fixed

- Docstrings are again valid markdown, instead of reStructuredText. Regression
  was caused by the google-style docstrings parsing.

## v1.8.0 - 2025-02-02

### Added

- Support for python 3.13
- `make docs` now renders google-style docstrings properly
- Update `pre-commit` tool version inside `Dockerfile` used as base dev image

## v1.7.2 - 2024-11-04

### Fixed

- Simplified `package_name` variable, removed the need to run `context.py` to
  generate it. This should mean no need for unsafe calls
- Properly ignore test folders from coverage measurement

## v1.7.1 - 2024-10-27

## Fixed

- Fixed mismatching `poetry` version in `release.Dockerfile` to match main
  `Dockerfile`.

## v1.7.0 - 2024-10-26

### Added

- Updated pre-commit hook versions

### Fixed

- No more duplicate label warnings during `make docs`. Done by removing the
  (old) autodoc and using (new) autodoc2 exclusively, resolving the clash.
- Typo in use of `dynamic_versioning` inside `pyproject.toml` causing
  `dynamic_versioning=True` to be ignored, effectively set as if
  `dynamic_versioning=False`.
- Ruff TOML config in pre-commit now set properly

### Changed

- `package_name` variable is now derived from a python script. No functional
  change in the template, just how the value was computed.

## v1.6.0 - 2024-05-07

### Added

- New parameter `dynamic_version`, defaulting to `True`. Enable to use proximity
  to a git tag as package version. On git tags, package version is tag. On
  non-tagged commits, version is last tag + number of commits as post. Uses
  `poetry-dynamic-versioning`, using `dunamai` library
- New `make help` shows command help in repo
- `Makefile` now loads `.env` contents as variables, if file exists
- Python 3.12 now supported, default version of the template
- Updated pre-commit hook versions

### Fixed

- Remove astroid pinning from v1.4.0, upstream updated, no longer breaks
- Test file name no longer mangled by templating engine (as `tests/test_.py`)
- Markdownlint pre-commit hook no longer fails with "punycode dependency warn"

## v1.5.0 - 2024-01-26

### Changed

- No longer asking `package_name` as question with a default that's
  overrideable, now derived from `project_name` (converted to
  lowercase_with_underscore) without asking, as it was always intended.

### Added

- Allow setting a container registry when building. Run `make
  DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.io/example/ docker-build-release` to automatically tag
  the image with a specific registry.
- Gitignore's "Python files" section is now auto-fetched from latest
  Github/gitignore repo, see `make python-gitignore`.
- Git/docker ignore files are now shared via jinja templating, clearly
  delineated from the rest of the file (which can be edited by hand afterwards)

### Fixed

- Project name validator now allows more than lowercase characters (validating
  regex now `^[A-Z0-9].+$` instead of old `^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\' ]+$`).
- `make release` now uses annotated git tags instead of lightweight tags (per
  `man git-tag(1)`, non-annotated tags are for "private or temporary object
  labels", and won't show up in `git describe` by default).
- `make release` now more portable (previously relied on GNU date and GNU sed)
- Git/docker ignore files now properly ignore text editor swap/backup files.
- Docker context (cache) no longer gets invalidated due to git operations.

### Removed

- Internal `make lint` no longer runs `poetry-lock` hook, useless for a
  template-oriented `pyproject.toml`. No change for template users!

## v1.4.0 - 2023-10-06

### Added

- Release-oriented Dockerfile now uses the `poetry.lock` contents as deps.
  Via new impl of `make export-requirements`, copied into image.
- New `make check-requirements`, verifies `requirements.txt` == `poetry.lock`.
- Release-oriented dockerfile uses built CLI as entrypoint.
  Can now run `docker run {{ project-slug }}:0.1.0 --help`.

### Fixed

- `make docs` no longer crashes with exception: 'Module' object has no
  attribute 'doc'. Dep astroid v3.0.0 is breaking, pinned for the moment.

## v1.3.1 - 2023-09-05

### Fixed

- Replaced `docs/source/index.rst` to `index.md`. Docs all Markdown via myst.

### Removed

- Unnecessary file `.flake8` removed, not needed since move to `ruff`

## v1.3.0 - 2023-08-29

### Added

- New pre-commit hook `poetry-check` and `poetry-lock`, validating poetry setup
- Update `Dockerfile`, used as base dev image
  - Debian version bookworm
  - `poetry` to `1.6.1`
  - `pre-commit` to `3.3.3`
- New project-name validator rules, enforcing 'Capitalized With Spaces' rule

### Fixed

- `make lock` no longer updates dependencies, via `--no-update` flag.

### Removed

- `yamllint` pre-commit hook: yaml _validator_ already packed in default hooks,
  no need for yaml pretty-printer!

## v1.2.0 - 2023-08-24

### Added

- Explicit choice of "Google" docstring style

### Fixed

- Git repo initialization feature restored via `_tasks`
- `make build` now builds sdists (`source.tar.gz`) as well as bdist (wheels,
  binary package). This fixes `poetry publish` after `make (build)` uploading
  only a binary package without source
- `ruff` linter no longer yells about pydocstyle rules

## v1.1.0 - 2023-06-07

### Added

- Faster linting via `ruff`, replacing `flake8` and `isort` pre-commit hooks
- Dash/Zeal docsets are now generated in `docs/build/docset` via `make docs`
- Markdown support in python docstrings, via
  [myst-parser](myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) and [sphinx-autodoc2](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#using-markdown-myst-docstrings)

### Fixed

- Template self-tests now refer properly to current `HEAD` commit, not last tagged
- Fix pytest warnings via update of `pytest-coverage` to `4.*`

## v1.0.0 - 2023-05-02

### Added

- New python template using `copier>=7.1.0`, validated by tests and
  teaching/explaining itself via design document.
